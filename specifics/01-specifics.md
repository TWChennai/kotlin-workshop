### Functions

Kotlin functions are first-class, which means that they can be stored in variables and data structures,
passed as arguments to and returned from other higher-order functions. You can operate with functions in
any way that is possible for other non-function values.

* Extension functions
* Higher-Order /Lambdas/ Reciever functions
* Inline functions

### Classes
* Data classes
* ADT using Sealed classes

### Collections
* Kotlin Collections: Grouping and some function
